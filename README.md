## Media Team - Frontend Coding Challenge

### Task

Create a nested dropdown menu in Vue.js.

### Requirements

* The top level categories should be the only ones showing by default.
* When a top level category is hovered over and it has children then the direct children should be displayed.
* If the direct children also have children and are hovered then their direct children should be displayed.
* Repeat the previous bullet point for as long as there are children of categories.
* No designs are provided, so use your imagination when adding styling.

### Background

* The Vue CLI was used to create a basic Vue.js application.
* Example category data is provided in `/src/App.vue` inside `data`.
* Use this category data to created a nested dropdown menu.
* You can start the server by running `npm run serve`.
* Please zip up this folder and send over when completed or when time expires.

# Good Luck!
